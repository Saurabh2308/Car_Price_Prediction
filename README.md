# Project: Car Price Prediction

Objective:
The aim of this project is to develop a web application that predicts the price of used cars based on various features such as the car's make, model, year of manufacture, fuel type, and kilometers driven. Users can input these details into the application, and the system will provide an estimated price for the car.

Technologies Used:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Python (with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn)
Machine Learning Model: Linear Regression (trained on a dataset of used car listings)
Explanation:

HTML Template (index.html):

The HTML template provides the user interface for the car price prediction application.
It includes input fields for selecting the car's make, model, year of manufacture, fuel type, and kilometers driven.
A "Predict Price" button triggers the prediction process.
Below the form, there's a section to display the predicted price.
CSS Stylesheet (style.css):

The CSS stylesheet defines styles for elements in the HTML template.
Global styles ensure consistency by resetting margins, paddings, and using the border-box model.
A dark background color is applied to the body of the page.
Margin-top is set to create space between elements.
Specific styling is applied to an element with the id canvas, such as a black border.
JavaScript Functions (script.js):

JavaScript functions handle dynamic behavior in the web application.
load_car_models(company_id, car_model_id): This function populates the car model dropdown based on the selected company.
form_handler(event): Prevents the form from being submitted normally.
send_data(): Sends the form data to the server for prediction using AJAX.
Workflow:

Data Collection: Gather data on used car listings, including features like make, model, year, fuel type, kilometers driven, and price.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and format inconsistencies.
Model Training: Train a machine learning model (e.g., Linear Regression) on the preprocessed data to predict car prices based on features.
Web Application Development: Develop a web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive interface for users to input car details.
Backend Integration: Implement the backend using Python and necessary libraries to handle data processing and model prediction.
Deployment: Deploy the web application on a suitable platform to make it accessible to users.
Conclusion:
The car price prediction project combines data science and web development to create a user-friendly application for estimating the prices of used cars. By leveraging machine learning techniques and providing an intuitive interface, users can make informed decisions when buying or selling cars. This project demonstrates the integration of frontend and backend technologies to solve real-world problems effectively.
